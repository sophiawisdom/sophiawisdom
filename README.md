### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sophia Wisdom. I find computers fascinating. I write software as a job as well as a hobby. Contained here are my hobby projects, which exist mostly to scratch my itches. These were created less for a practical goal than to scratch the itch of creating, or to scratch the itch of making performant software, or to scratch the itch of seeing a thing to be possible and grabbing it. I am heavily inspired by Bret Victor's "Inventing on principle" but am still searching for the principle.

Projects I've worked on:
- Tweaks
    - test
- Stimulator
- Sillydb
- fast_du
