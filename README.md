### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sophia Wisdom. I find computers fascinating. I write software [as a job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-wisdom/) as well as a hobby. Contained here are my hobby projects, which exist mostly to scratch my itches. These were created less for a practical goal than to scratch the itch of creating, or to scratch the itch of making performant software, or to scratch the itch of seeing a thing to be possible and grabbing it. I am heavily inspired by Bret Victor's "Inventing on principle" but am still searching for the principle.

Projects you can find below:
- Tweaks
    - MacOS has an extraordinarily flexible and moldable heritage.
    - This heritage is mostly moldy and disused.
    - The remnants are sufficiently powerful to allow making your desired changes to other people's apps.
- Stimulator
    - Ever wandered around the city, tossing and turning over the most optimal path to your destination? Me too.
    - Simulates walking in the city and showcases different strategies under user-tunable scenarios to see which is the best.
    - Gives me peace of mind that my walking is truly optimal.
- Sillydb
    - Ever been frustrated at the magnitude of waste and annoyance that planet-scale systems cause?
    - Why not have your database just be on one machine? Sounds pretty nice right? This is that database, tuned for SSD performance.
