I am trying to sell datasets to LLM companies. Contact me at sophia@dataset.consulting if you're interested.
I'm also trying to build a course teaching people how to program GPUs to implement transformers and transformer-adjacent things. Soon I will be able to teach people -- let me know if you're interested in this.

I'm interested in learning and understanding. See my website https://girl.surgery for more on this.
