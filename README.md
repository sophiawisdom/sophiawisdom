### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sophia Wisdom. I find computers fascinating. I write software [as a job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-wisdom/) as well as a hobby. Contained here are my hobby projects, which exist mostly to scratch my itches. These were created less for a practical goal than to scratch the itch of creating, or to scratch the itch of making performant software, or to scratch the itch of seeing a thing to be possible and grabbing it. I am heavily inspired by Bret Victor's "Inventing on principle" but am still searching for the principle.

Projects you can find below:
- Tweaks
    - MacOS has an extraordinarily flexible and moldable heritage, in Smalltalk (through ObjC) and Mach (through XNU)
    - This heritage is mostly moldy and disused
    - The remnants are sufficiently powerful to allow arbitrary code reloading on running applications. Ever wanted to make some small modification to the calendar app, knowing the original authors would never want that? Tweaks is how you do that.
- Stimulator
- Sillydb
- fast_du
