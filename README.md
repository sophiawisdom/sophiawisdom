### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sophia Wisdom. I find computers fascinating. I write software [as a job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-wisdom/) as well as a hobby. Contained here are my hobby projects, which exist mostly to scratch my itches. These were created less for a practical goal than to scratch the itch of creating, or to scratch the itch of making performant software, or to scratch the itch of seeing a thing to be possible and grabbing it. I am heavily inspired by Bret Victor's "Inventing on principle" but am still searching for the principle.

Projects you can find below:
- Tweaks
    - MacOS has an extraordinarily flexible and moldable heritage.
    - This heritage is mostly moldy and disused.
    - The remnants are sufficiently powerful to allow arbitrary changes to other people's apps.
- Stimulator
- Sillydb
- fast_du
